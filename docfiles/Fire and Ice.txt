(/)Title: Fire and Ice
(/)Doctags: robert frost
(/)Pages: Some say the world will end in fire,
Some say in ice.
From what I've tasted of desire
I hold with those who favor fire.
But if it had to perish twice,
I think I know enough of hate
To say that for destruction ice
Is also great
And would suffice.<pwords>The end
